I am going to try to keep up my blog again.  But, this time I am going to use a wordpress.com blog instead of my own domain.  I am tired of putting it up and then letting it expire and then forgetting to renew and then having to repurchase my domain and set the site up again.  With wordpress.com I don't have to worry about it, it is just there.  Granted, I don't have the ability to put up other content, development wise, but wordpress is pretty powerfull, and as far as online publishing of my written content, anything I would produce, I can pretty much count on the fact that I can use wordpress to put it up.

So, here we go again.  This is me back at a new job and back with a new blog.  Yeah!!!

Cool stuff I am looking at now...

1. Azure
2. ASP.NET MVC
3. jQuery
4. Zoho
