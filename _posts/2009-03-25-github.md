Well I finally joined <a href="http://www.github.com/lilmudd" target="_blank">Github</a>, which is the coolest of course.  I started with just a little project for an httphandler to apply filters to images.  Something I need for work.  I have the <a href="http://johngilliland.wordpress.com/imagehandler/" target="_self">project's homepage here at my blog</a> for lack of a better location.  And I also added a page in the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/lilmudd/imagehandler" target="_blank">wiki at github</a> for good measure.  I am extra jazzed about the whole git thing.  I have been using it for local VC at work and at home.  I am still a little skittish about using git-svn, as it hosed on me the first time i tried to dcommit something, but all in all I am very pleased with Git itself.

You should checkout <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>, it is perfect, and you can pay a few bucks a month if you need private repos...
