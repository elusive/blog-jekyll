Yes I am posting again. I refuse to give up on my blog. I have been away from my hometown and my work for the last year and a half or so and I am now back and getting back into my routine. Much to my joy as I have missed all these things tremendously. I am back to work at GloryKidd Technologies and happy to have the opportunity.

Reminded daily why I have always loved Louisville. I am back in my old neighborhood Starbucks, clacking away. Hope to be able to post some new articles soon as I see where my new project takes me in the world of coding.
